# Azure AI Search Terraform templates

This repository contains multiple Terraform templates for provisioning Azure AI Search resources. Each template lives in its own directory:

- `entra-id/` – deploys the infrastructure and sample hotels index using Entra ID authentication.
- `api-key/` – original version that creates the sample index with a Search admin key.

Refer to the README in each folder for prerequisites and deployment steps. Run Terraform commands from the template directory you want to use.
